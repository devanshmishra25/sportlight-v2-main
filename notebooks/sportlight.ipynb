      "{'text': \" the champion. And there's money. Still has a big broad smile on his face. Oh, that's come back strongly. Challenge for the Empire. Close thing. Close shape. I've got him going to be whether it's out or not. That is a superb delivery. And the other balls of shine. Much swing. This seems to straighten up nicely. Beautiful scene. Shaving back in. Gambier. Maybe a little bit high. Oh, hitting the top of leg stump. And that's that like a footwork we've talked about with Gambier. Court on the crease. It could be a tester for the right hander. His wicket taking delivery is the out swinger. No slip in place. I'm just a little surprised. This is when you want about 13 fields. More host. And he's coming in. I think Vicki Pontings got a microphone straight to you, Remise. But he's got his out swinger going. Very, very dangerous. High 130 spin-helf in house. Another tester. 34. Got him going to be on strike. Brett Lee is running in. It's gone. It's gone all the way. Difficult one for Adam Gilchrist. It's flying. Set it top the bat. Brett Lee not happy. That goes against his speakers. Wonder for a moment there. Gilchrist thought he had that. He's a tall man. He's got long arms. Adam Gilchrist. So he can get to. No chance there. Wrong footed him. Very, very tough. Good cricket from Gotham Gambiri. Ran very quickly for that single. That's gone too. Strip clasp. He's got a lot of time. He's got a lot of time. He's got a lot of time. He's got a lot of time. Two. Strip clack is a feel of Brett Lee. Once again disappointed. Five runs credited to Gotham Gambiri. That's poor stuff. It's all the sorry mate from Sturacol. And I think Brett will here we, too worried. Marco Clark throwing it in. He's a bit of a throw-all just Marco Clark. He can't help himself. Sturacol is team-hate from his self-wealth. I know that. And Brett Lee hasn't bowed to many bad balls. He's gone for nine off two balls. Nice he played by the Parfax shot to look. He's been put away before. What more it's a no ball. It's all happening out there. Did Freddie Krueger just run in? Because this is nightmare on Elm Street for Brett Lee. Four-eight off the over. Only two legitimate balls bowed. Good luck. I think that's a fair call, Ramaysa. Very fair. Nicely tucked away for four by Otape. He's got the strike for a free hit. I think he'll be ready for the shot. Good stuff. I think he's going to bounce him. He's down the track. He's up on the gap. Walk into that drive. Good thinking from Otape. Yeah, he ran down the crease. We haven't seen the free hit. Maximized so far in this tour. No problems there. Real pressure for Brett Lee. Make sure you keep your smile on your face. Once you hit the gap on this field, it runs all the way. Very, very quickly. He picks up pace on the bounce. So pressure on the Australians. Will you throw again? Clark as the field at point. It's a more gentle return this time from him. Players got the yips in the field. Indians had it. The Australians not going too cleanly either. So Brett Lee, 18 off the over. That's what Indian ate. The champs are going to goals. You pick it in hand. You think they'll give it. The champ goes up. It's been a terrific over for the Indian team. 19 from five balls now. This partnership is in motion. It's in fast forward. 29 off 17 balls. His partnership. That man there. He hits the ball very hard and long. So Brett Lee charges in. Freeze last ball. He's trying to need a wicket. He's going to come around the wicket. That's the LBW. Maybe setting him up for a bounce in here. He's going to come around the wicket. Far legs back. So delivery and pick up one. Got him. Gumball. 20 off the over. India. 51. Going well in there at the moment. The youngsters doing a good job. Gumball on 21. Uttappa. 115. India going at 9.68 at the moment. Gumball is blasted back and has got it through the end field. We'll get another boundary. This crowd is getting very vocal. Now the four to the Indians. A little bit of in swing for hills. Feel for us. Going to get another boundary. This crowd is getting very vocal. Now the four to the Indians. A little bit of in swing for hills. Feel for us. Getting it through the on side. Anything through the end field goes for four. Gumball is doing well in this format. Three half centuries in the world covered South Africa. These two youngsters are good at picking up singles as well. Now the first ever time international. 20-20 match. It's certainly well so far. Saini Gavascar in the center of Scream. A lot of seats in the country at the moment. What's his name again? He's everywhere. Go back there. Shah Rukkan. Uttappa, it is Matt. We'll take the limelight. Still have a little bit left. Steering out to be a sensation of clear. This part about Uttappa scores all around the ground. This occasion just bringing the bottom hand in and whipping it. Down the pitch and whips it over. Square leg. One bounce. Almost maximum. Been learning off Matthew Hayden. The head was very steady. He's got the back. He was taking a couple of yards down the pitch. Almost stepping. Single-deck-in. There will be another free hit. Second, no ball from Hilton House. Just in his second over. I'm piring him. Can be on strike. And you can tell he's over the line. Good call from the up. The field can change. Rookie Pontings having a chat with his bowler. Left handed Gambia on strike. Currently a deep square leg. And a third man. That's what they're going to go with. A ring filled on the offside. He's going to be a third. One for the third shot. Where's the man in the deep? He's taking the catch and might be a six. He's going to be out because he's a free hit. We'll have to check with the third and baya. We'll feel in the deep not doing too well. Not had in I think it was in the deep. The tight call to the third and baya as well. Great had it is. Didn't know where the boundary line was. Took the catch. Good shot by Gambia. It takes the catch, stumbles back. Oh, I might have to have another look at that. They have released it before his foot. Hit the padding. I can't really tell from that. Let's see the back leg now. Very close and he's giving it. Do the batting side. Draining pose in sixes. What an oar. This is being for India 17 runs so far. This is the fifth time. The next is the opportunity for a free hit. Questionful calling what gift is there. Chandra Silva. The batsman took it away for a six. Now it's got the Gambian. We'll take the single. 68 for one. We'll have to pick up a couple of big hits here. There needs to be a bowling change. The Australians looking a little rattled. Bowling change. Gambia on strike. Stuart Clark is going to be the new bowler for Australia. He'd be quite relieved that he's bowling the seventh over. Because he could get some filters outside. Patrolling the boundary lines. He's got the ball. He's got the ball. He's got the ball. He's got the ball. It's a man in the deep just a single. This game has been sensational. Great response from the crowd. He's organised by the BCCI. A terrific job. Interest of the see how India go about this now. Only need seven runs and over. With nine wickets in hand. I can chip the ball around. Try and pick up a runner ball for a while. Sure call. That's what Ultipar does. 50 partnership up between these two. Just off 27 deliveries. The 100 required now is 7.1. The index can just afford to play the singles. Fantastic partnership. Contributions of 25 from God from Gambia. The number of boundaries. 4.4s and a 6 to Gambia. 4.4s to Utapa. Another good hit. Desk with Dave in the deep. With the ball will win the race. Gambia is playing quite beautifully. What to be as you're advancing down. The pitch so you can shoot a club dug at him but he was good enough to swivel back. On the way back foot and put it away. Matthew Hayden. The ball. The ball. The ball. It's got to watch out now. Control now, India. 93 from 80. Nine wickets in hand. Concerned, you're straight and clear. Ending's hands having a good time. This is where India charged the momentum. The ball. The ball. The ball. He's got both spinners on. Really slow the run right down. Australia haven't got a recognised spinner tonight. Leading Brad Hog out. Have to go with the likes of Michael Clark and Andrew Siamonds. It's all pace at the moment. It was just time. jedech's clapping. Gヨ bances. But keeping the hit back no Glad that Steve newk gets Atlanta and Josh as top player after easy and generous. Ten Taro gets Brent Lasca irgendwann steering. Got to be watchful with the line to it clock. 74 for 1. Okay in control. Andrew Simon's will be present to the attack. Contest will see if he does ball spinners. There was a bit in it for Harvajan saying with the pick of the ball is for India. Dominic Hart pick also got a few deliveries to turn. Robin Utaba looked to chance his arm. Legs like side. The ball turning into the right hander. Spaded by. We just a single. Got them a Gambit is a good player as winners. Australia had to change the pace. Andrew Simon has it done a lot of bowling of late. Again beer 48 light out of just 26 deliveries. Also working for the Indians as well. A right hand and a left hand combination. Keep in the Australians guessing. Three in the ring on the offside to save the single. In fact, changing his mind. He has two on the offside, two on the leg. Plenty of detection in the deep. Good use of the feet. Excellent feeling. Health and house. Suddenly saved a couple of runs. Such a sweet time with the ball. Users of the feet extremely well against the spinners. They're hitting through the line of the ball. Slowies pace up there. Andrew Simon is going to pick up another single. Really that's all they really need to do now in here. Ben Hylfenhaus is the filter. It's always handy when you've got your fastball as athletic field'sman as well. Good delivery. Not tall, it's his the Empire. It's been way consistent. The benefit of that has gone to the basement right through. I thought that was very close. It was the arm hole. So it swings back to the stumps. Maybe heights. Down the wickets. Matthew Hayden tardies up. Yeah, Hayden could be the only factor that saved Robynulta the leg before call. Heading him above the knee-roan. Flybrons of the oversaw far. It's 80 for one. Pretty decent start from Andrew Simon. It's just the six runs coming in the last over. You have to carry on Gambier-Northapa. Let's have some superb shots in this partnership. Active excitement here in Mumbai. Right from the half-know-people starting to pour into the ground. It's two o'clock and we will continue from the mid-air in. Good event side edge. Maybe big appeal from Gilchrist. I have to wait for the Empire's signal. The run's given. I thought there was an inside edge. Big appeal from Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Thought there was just a slight inside edge. Ball pitching in line. Thought I heard a slight inside edge. Good understanding. It's just made eye contact. The signal's always on. Okay, it's our chance. I'll be very happy to see themselves on the big screen. There's 20 20 rings in a different kind of a crowd. Alt together. It's a young alert. Want to have fun? Want to see a good game of cricket. It's Saturday night. Good delivery. Taking bottom Gambier by surprise. There's a big appeal by Ricky Pondting at Midwicket. 40 heard something but this is obviously a plan. Like it missed everything. Lot of short balls from the Australian bowlers. Has to be said so far. Hasn't worked. Both of these two players out there have handled all the Australian bowlers pretty well so far. Looking for a boundary. Haven't got a boundary in the last couple of overs. Feeling the urgency. Want to give the momentum going in there. Midwam was up so that was an area that he targeted. Ricky Pondting has now changed the field. Final legs come inside the circle which allows Midwam to drop back. Just lower delivery. We'll raise to the fence and there'll be a wide, five more runs to end up. It's two o'clock. Normally so accurate. Got the radar wrong on this occasion. Went for the Yorker. Spirited into the stumps. He's just pushed it down. Leg side. Want to swagger bit as well after it landed. Madam Gilchrist had no chance. Four more to the title. Doesn't matter how they get them. Again. Terrific running. It'll be time there's been a good ball. The man has to play it out. And look for the singles and got them. Where's this running between the wickets during their normal one day games? Australians do this sort of thing in most of their cricket, even test cricket. It's what now that there's more intensity in these 2020s, India may benefit with their running between the wickets. If you get it close down by your feet, it's very hard to get run out. What? Another single. It's 89 for one. All of them having fun. The crowd's having fun too. Simon's will continue. Just the six singles in his first over. Every now and again, India will look for a boundary. The tap power will look at mid-wicket. It's a big gap between the man at long on and deep-wit-wicket. It's an amazing single taken. It doesn't seem as too often against the Australians. The singles being taken inside the ring. Well, the Australians are in damage control at the moment. Most of the infield are pushed back. Right on the circle trying to stop the boundaries. The mid-wicket is a big gap between the two. In 2020, cricket will go with the intent of the opposition. Let's see a couple of times when the mid-winter was inside the ring. The batsman looked to clear the infield. Mid-winter was pushed along on. Oh, the reverse sweep comes out. And he's made good enough contact to think about boundary. You'll never know what Uttappa will come up with next. But we've seen this shot more and more these days. Those players practice this all the time. And it was a very good shot because Andrew Simon saw him switching over and speared it in. But his hands were quick enough. Crowd's getting excited all the time. Maybe just a single. The reverse sweep, in fact, he had to pick it from outside the next time. These pictures, the number sport production for the board of control for Gregor Nandial. Made the adjustment. No big turn for Simon's. Eight runs and there's over so far. We'll be more. At NDO with a boundary. Yes, it is. It's 101 for one. India 101 for one. We can now go down to Archana. There's got another prominent player with her. India and Australia have both started off really well. What do you reckon will happen? We definitely need a couple of wickets if we're going to have any chance of winning this match. India are in the box, so they're out at the moment. Hopefully, Papin or Michael Clark and Andrew Simon get a couple of wickets here and get the raker we need. Last time you were here at the Champions League, you're playing a 50-over game. Now you're playing this 20-over game. How's it different? A lot of it's just a lot quicker. Definitely a faster game. The only problem is we're not winning it. India in front. That's the only difference. Gump here is playing really well. No, both of them are battling really well. It's nice to watch, but we'd like to see the back of them. They're battling really well when they've played some good shots. It's exciting for the viewers. It certainly is. Thank you so much, Brad. Thank you very much. Brad Hogg there having a chat to Archana. One or two for one, Michael Clark has been introduced into the attack. Left arm spin. Now what can he do? Oh, he can spin the ball and he can possibly give Australia a breakthrough as well. Yes, indeed. And the way things stand at the moment, I believe they've got to stop the singles. Ramizh, because otherwise it's match over. That is a terrific delivery. They've got to get the field in, make the batsman play some risky shots. Otherwise the singles are coming far too easily and they need just about six and a half runs and over with Dine Wickets and Han. This is a confident India unit. And Gilles Christ, I think, has got rid of him. Michael Clark has picked up a Wicket just at the right time. Ricky Panting will be pretty delighted with what has happened out there. Othappa is the man. Clark was over the moon with that Wicket. It is a big Wicket just at the right time because the match was slipping away rather rapidly from Ricky Panting. So here is an opening. You've got one. They've got to get another. In quick succession to really get back into this one. It was a slide. I didn't spin back. And you're almost falling into Adam Gilles Christ. Big Wicket. Othappa gone for 35 and that partnership needed to be broken 82. These two put on Gumbher and Othappa. New batsman will take a while. That's what you need. You need an opening and they've got it in Michael Clark on inspired bowling choice by Ricky Panting. Got him to be once again playing a splendid hand. And he's away. You're broadcasting. He's threatening to come back for the second. It'll only be one. But Gumbher's growth has been phenomenal because he can play the spin really well and that's a great advantage. If you have an opener that can play spin as well as got him to be. 165 4s and 130s the strike rate. I guess Australia. I guess tremendous going. No is the call from you, Ratsing. Good over from Michael Clark. You're Ratsing is serving the field. Silicon afford to settle down is no real hurry. India have established a sound footing. He's coming from around the wicket to you, Ratsing. And that's punished. What a blow. That's a hundred spoil from you, Ratsing. A rank long hop and that was absolutely smashed. It was bludgeoned. Nobody moved. Deep midwicket. Untenmented. That's an absolute gift for you, Rats. Good running from bottom Gumbher. He's such a smart cricketer. Very fit. You, Rats, wants to come back for the second. Good responding very quickly to that call from you, Ratsing. This is the pull that you've watched played. No one moved. There was a deep midwicket in place but it's such a powerful hitter. Clean hitter. At plenty of time we had to find the zone. Doni's battered up to come on next. Australia do even things need wickets. It's less than seven runs and over required. So I keep thinking that they've got to stop the singles. Somehow find one or two more fielders in the circle. But at the moment they've got in a slip. Okay, that's an attacking option but that leaves even more holes into outfield. They're on there. He's reading the game well, Gokam Gumbher. Roy Chama is also parried up. You've had a great outing. Indian top, 58 to win from 51.
